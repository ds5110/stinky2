Turning stinky into a production site

## complaints

* Map
  * The map is compelling
  * Goal: automate the updates
* Nature of the complaints
  * Can this be turned into a classification problem?
  * Is such an analysis worthwhile? Are they all the same? Does intensity vary?
* Time-dependent word cloud or bar chart?
  * Is interactive filtering in time the best approach?
  * Or something else?

## predictability

* Whatâ€™s predictable in the data?
  * Seasonal signal? (e.g., temperature, complaint frequency)
  * Previous results show that there IS a seasonal effect
* Weather?
  * Complaints and wind speed and/or direction? (e.g., stagnant air? inversion layer?)
* Scatterplots
